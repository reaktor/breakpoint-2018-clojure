# breakpoint-app

Created using `lein new chestnut app +edge +re-frame +less +http-kit`.

Quick run instructions:

* `lein repl`
* `(go)`
* `(cljs-repl)` (for the clojurescript repl; exit to clj repl with `:cljs/quit`)
* You should add the Giphy API key to `breakpoint-app.config/giphy-api-key` with the repl or in the source code.
* Auto-reload works for most things, but you need to explicitly `(reset)` in the clj repl after changing routes.clj.

## Examples / Exercises

### Demo 1: Toggle the animation on/off with a button click

We will demonstrate how to add a simple button to update the application state.

### Exercise 1: Toggle the background color with a button click

This should give you an idea of how the unidirectional data flow in re-frame works.

* Start off by creating a new button. You can simply copy-paste the `animation-toggle` function to some other name, like `color-change` (you'll also want to change the text). To include the component in the page, you will also need to include it in the `main-panel` just like the existing `[animation-toggle]`, maybe right after it.
* Now, we need to use the button to dispatch an event that sets the application state's background color property to a desired value. To do this, we will use the `re-frame.core/dispatch` function in the button's on-click handler. The dispatch function will take a vector parameter which will contain a keyword as the event's name, and possibly some parameters after that. A example function that performs a dispatch: `#(dispatch [:color-event :black])`.
* Next, we should handle the event that we dispatch when the button is clicked. This is done in events.cljs, where we will create the event handler using `re-frame.core/reg-event-db`. This function is used to register a pure function that will update our application state. The parameters for the `reg-event-db` function are the event's name (a keyword) and the handler function. The function will receive as parameters the current app state, `db`, and a vector that holds the event name, and any possible parameters passed - in other words, the parameter given to the dispatch function. The function should return the updated application state. The event registration will look like: `(reg-event-db :color-event (fn [db [_ color]] (assoc db :background-color color))))`. This will set the `db` map's entry with the key `:background-color` to the value given.
* In order to refer to the app-db, and the color value therein, we must create a subscription. Subscriptions are used to access the app-db and their values will change whenever the app-db does. We will add a subscription in subs.cljs using the `re-frame.core/reg-sub` function. The usage looks much like `reg-event-db`: the parameters are the subscription's name (a keyword) and a function that receives the app-db map and should return data that is derived from the app-db. In our case, we just need to access the map value we just added: `(reg-sub :background-color (fn [db] (:background-color db)))`.
* Now we have access to the color, and just need to use it in our view. We have the necessary styles in place, so we can just set the `.black-background` style to the `.main-wrapper` div. To subscribe to the subscription created above, use the `re-frame.core/subscribe` function, providing the subscription name as a parameter. It will return the subscription, but you will need to dereference the subscription to get the contained value: `@(subscribe [:background-color])`. To put it all together, add a properties map to the `.main-wrapper` div (as its first element), and use the subscription: `{:class (when (= @(subscribe [:background-color]) :black) "black-background")}`.
* This will only allow you to set the background to black! How about making the button a toggle, or adding another button for the sky blue background?

### Exercise 2: Implement the 'Random Giphy' button.

This involves side-effectful event handlers — the backend API has been provided for you.

* Again, the "Load random" button needs to dispatch an event.
* We also need to create a handler for the event. This time we will need to do an AJAX call to the REST API, so it's a bit different from before. To help you along, we have provided a handler in events.cljs, which has been commented out. Un-commenting it should be enough for now (just note that you have matching event names in the dispatch and handler.)
* The handler has an `on-success` property, which is another dispatch, so we need to create a handler for that as well. Implement it using `reg-event-db`. The handler function will receive the JSON response as a parameter, so you can access it just like the `color` parameter in Ex. 1. The response contains a vector of images that should be appended to the `:images` entry in the app-db. You can do this in a few ways using `update`, the shortest probably being the function `into`, or a combination of `conj` and `flatten`.
* Next, create a subscription for the images. A stub is included and commented out in subs.cljs.
* To complete the final step of rendering the images, see the function `results-box` in views.cljs. In order to render an image, you can use the provided function `results-item` which takes one image as a parameter. Put the list of images inside `[:div.results-box]`, where you can use the `map` function to turn the list of image data (accessed with `@(subscribe [:the-subscription-you-just-created])`) into images.
* Once you get everything working, you will see some React warnings to the effect of `Every element in a seq should have a unique :key`. You can do this by adding the `:key` property to the outer div that the function `results-item` returns, with something unique as the value.
* If you have time to spare, how adding about YET ANOTHER button, which clears the list of images?

### Exercise 3: Text search

Here, you get to implement the entire end-to-end functionality.

* The text field currently console logs whatever is typed to it. Make it a - you guessed it - dispatch instead.
* Create a subscription using `reg-event-fx`. For now, only implement the app-db update with something like:

```clojure
(reg-event-fx
  :update-search
  (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ query-text]]
    {:db (assoc db :search-input query-text)}))
```

.. which could be achieved by using `reg-event-db`, for now.

* Also change the `value` entry for the text field in views.cljs — you probably noticed it has been hard-coded to be the empty string. Instead, subscribe to the actual value that is now in the app-db.
* To create a HTTP request, add a `:http` key to the `:update-search` handler function's return value. The format can be copied from the `:load-random` handler, but the URI should be constructed to be something like: `/api/search?q=searchterm` (see the `str` function for help).
* To create a corresponding backend endpoint, see routes.clj in `/src/clj/breakpoint_app`. Use the existing `/api/random` endpoint definition to create a new one, with the following changes:
  * The path should be `/api/search`
  * Add a query parameter definition: `:query-params [q :- String]` after the `:return` definition.
  * In the body, call the search function: `(ok (giphy/search q))`.
  * NB: you have to manually issue the `(reset)` command in the clj REPL after changing the route definitions!
* Now see giphy.clj and implement the function `search`. Again, you can copy-paste the `random` definition, but you will have to change the parameters to the function `query-url`. The first one should be `search` and the second a map contains query parameters to the Giphy API request. The text string to search for should be named `q`. You can try the `query-url` function in your REPL to ensure you've got it right.

Since we are using the existing `:add-images` handler to deal with the API response, the text search should now be working! However, performing the search after every keypress is rather dirty. We can fix this by only firing the search after there has been a short time of inactivity in the text field:

* We have a commented-out `dispatch-debounced` effects hander registration in events.cljs. Check it out to see how to add new types of handlers and uncomment it!
* In the `:update-search` handler, remove (but don't throw away!) the `:http-xhrio` definition in the returned map.
* Replace it with a `:dispatch-debounced` entry. The value should be a map, which is passed to the function in the `dispatch-debounced` fx handler. In its implementation, you can see that the keys `:id` (any keyword) `:dispatch` (a dispatch name like `[:do-search]`) and `:timeout` (in milliseconds) should be included, so do so.
* Add the handler for the dispatch you just created. It should be of the `reg-event-fx` type and contain the `:http-xhrio` definition you removed a few steps earlier. Note that you also have to dig out the query text from the app-db.

After this you should experience a much smoother text search!

### Exercise 4: Remove image

Clicking the remove button on image cards should remove the image from the app-db and view.

### Exercise 5: Add to saved images

Add a "saved images" element, to which you can images with the 'plus' button.

### Exercise 6: Persist liked images to backend.

Add a button that pushes liked images to the backend, and re-populates the saved image element on page load. A simple `atom` can serve as your database in the backend.

## Development

Open a terminal and type `lein repl` to start a Clojure REPL
(interactive prompt).

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(go)
(cljs-repl)
```

The call to `(go)` starts the Figwheel server at port 3449, which takes care of
live reloading ClojureScript code and CSS, and the app server at port 10555
which forwards requests to the http-handler you define.

Running `(cljs-repl)` starts the Figwheel ClojureScript REPL. Evaluating
expressions here will only work once you've loaded the page, so the browser can
connect to Figwheel.

When you see the line `Successfully compiled "resources/public/app.js" in 21.36
seconds.`, you're ready to go. Browse to `http://localhost:10555` and enjoy.

**Attention: It is not needed to run `lein figwheel` separately. Instead `(go)`
launches Figwheel directly from the REPL**

## Trying it out

If all is well you now have a browser window saying 'Hello Chestnut',
and a REPL prompt that looks like `cljs.user=>`.

Open `resources/public/css/style.css` and change some styling of the
H1 element. Notice how it's updated instantly in the browser.

Open `src/cljs/breakpoint-app/core.cljs`, and change `dom/h1` to
`dom/h2`. As soon as you save the file, your browser is updated.

In the REPL, type

```
(ns breakpoint-app.core)
(swap! app-state assoc :text "Interactivity FTW")
```

Notice again how the browser updates.

### Lighttable

Lighttable provides a tighter integration for live coding with an inline
browser-tab. Rather than evaluating cljs on the command line with the Figwheel
REPL, you can evaluate code and preview pages inside Lighttable.

Steps: After running `(go)`, open a browser tab in Lighttable. Open a cljs file
from within a project, go to the end of an s-expression and hit Cmd-ENT.
Lighttable will ask you which client to connect. Click 'Connect a client' and
select 'Browser'. Browse to [http://localhost:10555](http://localhost:10555)

View LT's console to see a Chrome js console.

Hereafter, you can save a file and see changes or evaluate cljs code (without
saving a file).

### Emacs/CIDER

CIDER is able to start both a Clojure and a ClojureScript REPL simultaneously,
so you can interact both with the browser, and with the server. The command to
do this is `M-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript`.

We need to tell CIDER how to start a browser-connected Figwheel REPL though,
otherwise it will use a JavaScript engine provided by the JVM, and you won't be
able to interact with your running app.

Put this in your Emacs configuration (`~/.emacs.d/init.el` or `~/.emacs`)

``` emacs-lisp
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl
      "(do (user/go)
           (user/cljs-repl))")
```

Now `M-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript` (shortcut: `C-c M-J`, that's a capital
"J", so `Meta-Shift-j`), point your browser at `http://localhost:10555`, and
you're good to go.

## Testing

To run the Clojure tests, use

``` shell
lein test
```

To run the Clojurescript you use [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo). This can
run your tests against a variety of JavaScript implementations, but in the
browser and "headless". For example, to test with PhantomJS, use

``` shell
lein doo phantom
```

## Deploying to Heroku

This assumes you have a
[Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc), have installed the
[Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), and have done a
`heroku login` before.

``` sh
git init
git add -A
git commit
heroku create
git push heroku master:master
heroku open
```

## Running with Foreman

Heroku uses [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to run your
app, which uses the `Procfile` in your repository to figure out which
server command to run. Heroku also compiles and runs your code with a
Leiningen "production" profile, instead of "dev". To locally simulate
what Heroku does you can do:

``` sh
lein with-profile -dev,+production uberjar && foreman start
```

Now your app is running at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in production mode.
